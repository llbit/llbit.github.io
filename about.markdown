This is the personal blog of Jesper Ã–qvist.

I am a software engineer working on compiler construction and programming language design.
Currently I am employed by Cognibotics and developing a compiler for a
statically typed variant of the Julia programming language.

I wrote my PhD on using attribute grammars for declarative semantic analysis.

I maintain the ExtendJ extensible Java compiler (a Java compiler written with attribute grammars).

I created Chunky, an open source path tracing renderer for Minecraft worlds.
