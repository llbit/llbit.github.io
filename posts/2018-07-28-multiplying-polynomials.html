          <h1>Multiplying Polynomials with Fast Fourier Transform</h1>
<!-- date={2018-07-28} -->

<p>I recently learned a very strange way of multiplying polynomials.</p>
<p>The straightforward way of multiplying two polynomials of degree n takes O(n^2) time: multiply each term from one polynomial with each term from the other.</p>
<p>There is a clever algebraic optimization that has running time O(n^lg3). Explanations of that algorithm can be found <a href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~saunders/courses/621/99f/p17a/p17.pdf">here</a>, <a href="http://www.cse.ust.hk/~dekai/271/notes/L03/L03.pdf">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiply-two-polynomials-2/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, there is a much faster O(n log n) algorithm. Even more surprisingly, the algorithm solves the problem via a completely different mathematical domain by using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The algorithm works as follows: take the DFT of the input polynomials, point-wise multiply them together, then take the inverse DFT to get the result. Plain DFT is not fast enough, taking O(n^2) time, but the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) can be used instead and it takes only time O(n log n). Point-wise multiplication takes time O(n), so the total running time is O(n log n)!</p>

<p>A detailed explanation of the FFT-based algorithm can be found in <em>Introduction to Algoithms, Second Edition,</em> by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein (Chapter 30). The best and most complete description I've read is the one from the book, but there are a few resources online: like <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~maier/cs584/Lectures/lect07b-11-MG.pdf">these lecture notes</a> which summarize/copy material from the book.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier Transforms</a> are normally used for digital signal processing applications (image, audio processing). The Fourier Transform breaks up a signal into its individual frequencies. Polynomial multiplication, on the other hand, is a form of combinatorial problem. Learning that we can use FFT to multiply polynomials makes me wonder if FFT can be used to speed up other problems in combinatorics.</p>
